            <blockquote>Learn to start thinking like a software engineer</blockquote>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
                Software engineers use computer programming languages to build interesting tools by “speaking” directly
                to the computer.
            </p>
            <p>
                What is a programming language? What types of tasks can be accomplished using code? How is it similar or
                different from the human languages we speak? And how do programmers continue to grow their skillset to
                dynamically solve the problems that arise on the job?
            </p>
            <p>
                These questions will be addressed in this objective. You should come away with a basic understanding of
                how to think like a computer programmer.
            </p>
            <h3>What is a software engineer?</h3>
            <p>
                In the most direct sense, a software engineer is someone who writes computer code in order to create and
                maintain software. Software engineers must understand computer languages in order to build software, but
                more importantly, they need to be able to think on their feet. Software engineers are often required to
                maintain, expand, and debug existing codebases. They also may be asked to learn new languages or
                frameworks on the job. The greatest skill a software engineer must possess is being able to stay calm in
                the face of a complex problem, and using his or her own creativity (and with the aid of online
                resources), he or she finds the solution to that problem.
            </p>

            <h3>How do we communicate with computers to accomplish tasks?</h3>
            <p>
                Computers are everywhere: in our office, in our pocket, in our cars, etc. We have become so accustomed
                to having them in our everyday lives that we often fail to recognize how complex they truly are. Many
                people never stop to ask how these devices work, as if assuming they are running on magic. What we often
                fail to realize is that every computer is following instructions that a human wrote for it in a set of
                languages that computers understand. Knowing these languages, a programmer can instruct computers to do
                almost anything imaginable — build a website, create an <abbr>AI</abbr> chess player, store and retrieve
                data in a
                database, and even drive our cars for us.
            </p>
            <p>
                While the specifics can look wildly different based on what type of task we’re trying to accomplish and
                what language we’re working with, there are three basic steps to writing code:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>understand the rules of the language</li>
                <li>use those rules to construct a set of instructions (write a program)</li>
                <li>allow the computer to read those instructions (execute the program)</li>
            </ol>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>How do we learn a programming language?</h3>
            <p>
                Learning your first computer language can be intimidating. It requires a level of precision that we may
                not be used to. However, just like human languages, the more programming languages you learn, the easier
                it gets.
            </p>
            <p>
                In most computer languages the core building blocks are keywords and syntax. Keywords are special words
                built into the language that cue the computer as to what your intentions are. For example, in JavaScript
                the keyword ‘const’ tells the computer that you are about to store a piece of data in memory. These
                keywords are built into the language and are designed to accomplish specific tasks. Syntax is a built-in
                system of “grammar” that each language has. It tells us how we are supposed to construct commands, such
                as the word order and the use of symbols and punctuation (such as brackets, semicolons, and equal
                signs).
            </p>
            <p>
                By knowing the keywords and symbols in a language (syntax) we can construct valid commands which give
                the computer precise instructions on how to execute certain tasks.
            </p>
            <p>
                Luckily, each language has its keywords and syntax well documented online. Languages have official
                reference pages where you can see lists of keywords and examples of how to use them. We can use a
                variety of other resources as well, such as YouTube, StackOverflow, and coding blogs, to see examples
                and explanations of these languages.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Which language should we learn?</h3>
            <p>
                There are a multitude of computer programming languages and they can differ in the grammar structure,
                spelling, meanings of words, and intent. New languages are usually created when a group of programmers
                finds the current languages lacking in an area they are working on. In turn, most languages are
                specialized in specific areas (web development, gaming, databases, and etc).
            </p>

            <h3>Where do we write code (text editors and sandbox environments)?</h3>
            <p>
                We’ll be writing code directly in a text editor. Some great free text editors I recommend are VSCode,
                Atom and Sublime. In this module, however, we will not need a text editor. We will be writing our code
                directly in sandbox environments (e.g., CodePen and repl.it). Sandbox environments are websites designed
                to allow you to write and immediately run small pieces of code. They are great learning tools for
                beginners and excellent debugging tools for experts.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>How do we execute code?</h3>
            <p>
                After we have written a bit of computer code, we must actually feed our instructions to the computer.
                This process is called executing, or running, the code. The exact process of running code can vary
                depending on the language and the task at hand. For example, a bit of HTML code can be run by opening an
                HTML file using a web browser. However, if we were to open a C++ file directly in the browser, nothing
                would happen.

            <h3>What is web development?</h3>
            <p>
                Web development is a specific field of software engineering that focuses on building web pages. Web
                pages, or web apps, are codebases that are downloaded and run in our web browser (e.g., Google Chrome)
                each time a user navigates to the website address. This differs from other software which is usually
                downloaded once and run as a standalone application on your computer or phone. Web development makes for
                an exciting career, as a web development cycle is usually much shorter and you get to iterate over your
                software at a much faster rate.
            </p>
            <p>
                The major building blocks of the web are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We will be talking about all three
                languages. We can also think of web development as being split into two main categories: front end and
                back end. We will discuss what each entails.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>What is meant by the term <code>front end</code>?</h3>
            <p>
                Everything you have ever seen on the web is considered ‘front end’. Front end is what we see when we
                open a web page or app. Code is downloaded from a server and is rendered to the screen by a web browser.
                What happens when we interact with the code is also considered front end. This is often referred to as
                the ‘Presentation Layer’ or ‘Client’ in software development terms.
            </p>
            <p>
                The front end is built out of three languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML allows us to put content
                on our page: text, headers, images, buttons, links, and etc. CSS is used to style our page. It allows
                the contents to have different text colors, background colors, as well as dealing with the positioning
                of the content on the page. JavaScript makes our page dynamic. It allows for the content to change on a
                mouse hover or click and also lets us submit data and have data rendered on our page (such as submitting
                a new blog post or having your feed populated when you open Facebook).
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>What is meant by the term <code>back end</code>?</h3>
            <p>
                This term usually refers to what happens ‘behind the scenes’: servers, databases, etc. The back end is
                the place we don’t see as users. This consists of data storage (databases) and servers running to
                provide data for the front end. Back end can be a little harder to imagine, especially for someone
                without much experience with it. Back end is commonly referred to as the ‘data access layer’ or ‘server’
                within software development terms. The back end computes the data and content sent to the front end to
                be used and displayed by your browser.
            </p>
            <p>
                Back end server code can be written using JavaScript. However, it can be also written using many other
                languages, such as Ruby, Java, or Python. The database logic required in back end development often
                utilize a database language, such as SQL or MongoDB.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>What is a framework?</h3>
            <p>
                Real world web development relies heavily on the use of frameworks. Frameworks aren’t exactly new
                languages, but are more like add-ons to existing languages. These frameworks slightly change the rules
                and syntax of a language, but save us a lot of time and effort in writing web development code.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, a CSS framework like Bootstrap will require us to write our CSS using slightly different
                rules than regular (vanilla) CSS. It will also limit the level of customization we can do using CSS. But
                the drawbacks are often worth it, because Bootstrap makes styling our sites far easier and allows us to
                create mobile-friendly pages with minimal effort.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>What are unique challenges web developers face?</h3>
            <p>
                While there are a lot of pros in developing software for use on the web, there are some cons as well.
                These can be unique challenges to a web developer.
            </p>
            <p>
                Load times. Do you ever go to a website and it takes forever to load? What is your reaction? We usually
                get frustrated and leave. In fact, most users will leave a site if it does not load for them in 15
                seconds or less! As mentioned earlier, connection speed is a large hurdle to overcome when dealing with
                web development. A user’s speed can range from very fast (Fiber optic) to slow (mobile 3G or satellite).
                It is our job as web developers to take ALL users into account. Therefore, we learn tricks to keep users
                engaged while our code is being downloaded, and learn to keep our code small so it can be easily
                downloaded.
            </p>
            <p>
                Different Browsers. Not only do we have to worry about load times, but also differences in browser
                technology. Mobile browsers are different than desktop (or laptop) browsers. Older browsers (many
                computers still use Windows XP and IE9) are extremely different than newer browsers, and developing for
                each provides a unique challenge. Ultimately you will need to make sacrifices and not support some
                browsers (which is a call marketing department will make) but you should be able to code for the browser
                you do support.
            </p>
            <p>
                Accessibility. If you are not a person that uses an accessibility device to consume software on the web,
                then you may have no idea these exist. Screen readers, alternative keyboards/navigation devices, devices
                for the hearing impaired, the color blind, font sizes for visually impaired people, are all concepts
                that we tend to not think about. As a web developer, you will need to start thinking about these users
                not only from a human decency perspective, but also because these users make up a non-insignificant
                market share. There are also legal issues that require accessibility.

            <h3>Learn</h3>
            <blockquote>Learn to use HTML code to create a basic webpage</blockquote>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
                One of the core building blocks of web development is the HTML language. HTML is used to put content on
                a web page: everything from text to images to buttons. We will be learning the basic rules of the HTML
                language to construct a simple web page.
            </p>
            <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
            <p>
                As already mentioned, HTML (which stands for Hyper Text Markup Language) is one of the languages we use
                for web development. HTML was created as a language when the first visual web browsers came into
                existence in the early 90s. It is read by the browser and then used as a blueprint for displaying
                information on your screen.
            </p>
            <p>
                HTML is not considered a “programming language”, but is rather what we call a “markup language”. This
                means that it is specifically designed to render data in a graphical form (rather than execute tasks).
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>What are HTML elements?</h3>
            <p>
                HTML is made up of elements. We can think of elements as being boxes of content on our web page.
                Different types of content will be contained in different boxes. For example, we use certain elements
                for headers, other elements for images, and still other elements for text.
            </p>
            <p>
                We will be focusing on four different display elements today: division elements (divs), headers,
                paragraphs, and spans.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>How do we use CodePen?</h3>
            <p>
                We will be writing our HTML code in a sandbox environment called CodePen. CodePen is a great learning
                tool (as well as a great place to tinker with small chunks of code on the job). We write HTML directly
                in the HTML section of CodePen and the elements that we create will render in real-time onscreen. This
                is much faster than having to save our file and reload it in the browser every time we make a change.
            </p>
            <p>
                CodePen also allows us to leave out a couple of critical elements: the html, head, and body elements.
                These are important to understand when we start writing HTML code in our text editors, but for now, we
                can ignore them, because CodePen handles them automatically.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>What are tags?</h3>
            <p>
                To create an HTML element, we need to use tags. Each element has a specific tag name such as div, p, or
                span. These tag names are built into the language and must be written exactly as expected in order for
                our HTML to render correctly. For example, paragraph is not a valid tag name in HTML, but p is. We can
                use online documentation to verify which tag names exist and what elements they are used for.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once we know our tag name, we can create an opening tag using brackets: These tags must be syntactically
                precise: an opening bracket + a tag name + a closing bracket. A
                closing tag looks almost exactly the same, except with a backslash before the tag name. So a closing
                paragraph tag would look like this:. Thus, to create a paragraph, we need only write an opening tag
                and a closing tag:
            </p>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/introduction_to_web/empty_p_example.png" alt="Empty p tag example">
            </figure>
            <p>
                Of course, a paragraph isn’t very interesting without text. The content of an HTML element always goes
                in between the two tags. So a paragraph containing some content would look like this:

                <strong>So what are divs, headers, paragraphs, and spans exactly?</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                We will be focusing today on four types of display elements. Now that we understand how to create these
                elements, let’s explore their use cases.
            </p>
            <p>
                The p (“paragraph”) element. This element is meant for holding text. By default, it will render text to
                the screen on a new line.
            </p>

            <p>
                The div element is a generic container. It is used primarily for grouping other HTML elements together.
                It is invisible by default but can be used to position or style a group of elements.
            </p>

            </figure>
            <p>
                The span element is a generic text container. It does not create a new line like the p element does.
                This element is invisible by default but can be used for styling words or phrases within a larger body
                of text.

            <p>
                These are header tags there are intended to be used as a way to present the subject matter of the page.
                1 is the most important and 6 is the least important. By default, 1 will be the largest, 2 will be the
                next largest, and etc.

            <h3>How can I inspect an existing web page?</h3>
            <p>
                When learning HTML, it can be useful to investigate existing web pages. There is a tool built into every
                browser called the inspector that allows us to do this. Just right-click any element on a webpage and
                select “inspect” or “inspect element”, depending on the browser. This will pop up a sidebar that allows
                you to explore all the HTML on the web page. It can be overwhelming for a new developer, but it is a
                good way to get a taste of what goes into building a complex, production web page.
