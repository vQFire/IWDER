                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p><abbr>HTML</abbr> is one of the core building blocks of the Internet. You should learn what it is and

                    the basic tags to get content to appear on a screen.</p>

                <code>What is <abbr>HTML</abbr>?</code>
                <p>
                    Hypertext markup language. It is the language that web browsers read to build a web page. It acts as
                    a ‘blueprint’ to display data on a user’s screen. This is the basic building block of the web. Every
                    page on the Internet is just <abbr>HTML</abbr> at its core.
                </p>
                <code>What are <abbr>HTML</abbr> elements?</code>
                <p>
                    Elements are what we use to tell the browser how we want the data supplied to be displayed.
                </p>
                <code>What is a ‘tag’?</code>
                <p>
                    An element consists of an opening and closing tag. The data supplied between the tags will be
                    displayed per the instructions of the element.
                </p>
                <code>How does the browser use <abbr>HTML</abbr> to create what I see?</code>
                <p>
                    The browser reads and interprets the <abbr>HTML</abbr> file to understand how the developer intended
                    the data to
                    appear on the screen.
                </p>
                <code>What are the basic <abbr>HTML</abbr> elements?</code>
                <p>
                    The elements we learned about were <code>html</code>, <code>head</code>, <code>body</code>, <code>‘p’</code>,
                    <code>span</code>, <code>div</code>, and <code>h1-h6</code>

                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    There are dozens of elements available in <abbr>HTML</abbr>. However, just a handful are used 90% of
                    the time. I
                    will only cover the most commonly used in this lesson. You can achieve virtually anything you want
                    with the most basic <abbr>HTML</abbr> elements and some CSS (which we will talk about later). It is
                    important to
                    note though that there is an idea in web development that your <abbr>HTML</abbr> elements should
                    match the exact
                    information you are attempting to display. This is known as being ‘semantically correct’, and this
                    method uses all of the available <abbr>HTML</abbr> elements. This is done for a number of reasons
                    including
                    accessibility and SEO. We will not learn about this method in the lesson, but you should know that
                    it exists.
                </p>
                <h3>Attributes</h3>
                <p>
                    Before we jump into learning about a couple more <abbr>HTML</abbr> elements, let’s learn about
                    another way to
                    supply data to an element. We know that we can supply text between two tags, but what if what we are
                    trying to display cannot be textually based? We can include this data with special flags right
                    inside of our tags. This is known as an attribute. We will see attributes in action in the next
                    section.
                </p>
                <h3>More Elements</h3>
                <blockquote>
                    <code>&#60;a&#62;</code>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    The ‘a’ (“anchor”) element, allows us to create links to other web pages (or even to other areas
                    within our own web page). You will always see the ‘a’ element used with the href attribute to tell
                    the browser what address you want the link to point to.
                </p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="images/html_css_fundamentals/anchor_example.png" alt="Anchor code example">
                </figure>
                <blockquote>
                    <code>&#60;img&#62;</code>
                </blockquote>
                <figure>
                    <img src="images/html_css_fundamentals/img_example.png" alt="Image code example">
                </figure>
                <p>
                    This element will display an image on the screen. It will always have an ‘src’ attribute which
                    points to the address of the image to be displayed. NOTE: img tags can be self-closing, as in they
                    do not need two tags. Simply put the / before the closing bracket in the first tag:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <code>&#60;ul&#62;</code> and <code>&#60;ol&#62;</code>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    This element represents an “unordered list”. This is the parent element and will contain list items.
                    There is also an ordered list &#60;ol&#62;, but is rarely used in modern web development, as most
                    developers like to style their lists themselves.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <code>&#60;li&#62;</code>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    The companion to the <code>&#60;ul&#62;</code> and <code>&#60;ol&#62;</code>. These elements
                    represent the items to appear in the list. Any other elements can appear in an
                    <code>&#60;li&#62;</code>.
                </p>

                </figure>
                <h3>Nesting Elements and Indentation</h3>
                <p>
                    We’ve seen in previous examples that we can nest elements inside of tags. In fact, this is a major
                    part of writing <abbr>HTML</abbr>. Nested elements are referred to as <code>children</code> and the
                    top level elements as
                    <code>parents</code>. You will see this type of structure throughout your time writing
                    <abbr>HTML</abbr> (and all
                    code for
                    that matter). One thing to note is that while indentation is not a requirement of <abbr>HTML</abbr>
                    (nor of <abbr>CSS</abbr>
                    and JavaScript), it is still often practiced as a readability issue. We not only write code for
                    ourselves, but also for our teammates and those that come after us. Indentation lets your code be
                    much more easily read and understood.

                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    <abbr>HTML</abbr> is great, but <abbr>HTML</abbr> alone is plain and boring. This was the case
                    during early days of the
                    Internet: web pages were very basic, text-only sites. Then came along <abbr>CSS</abbr> (Cascading
                    Style Sheets),
                    which allowed us to put some color and style into our web pages! It’s like the difference between
                    black & white and color <abbr>TV</abbr>.
                </p>
                <h3>Introduction to Cascading Stylesheets.</h3>
                <p>
                    Before we begin, let’s think about the analogy of a web page as a house. In order to build a house,
                    we need a few things. First, we need raw materials. Then, we need a plan. Then, we need paint and
                    decorations. Finally, we need electricity and plumbing to make everything work*. In this analogy,
                    our <abbr>HTML</abbr> is our raw materials. It has so much potential, but it’s just laying in a pile
                    on the
                    ground. We need a plan and a way to spruce it up and decorate it. That is where <abbr>CSS</abbr>
                    comes in.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    *the electricity and plumbing represents JavaScript which we will learn about later.
                </blockquote>
                <h3>What is <abbr>CSS</abbr>?</h3>
                <p>
                    As already mentioned, <abbr>CSS</abbr> stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a different language
                    than <abbr>HTML</abbr>.
                    It allows us to add color and style to our web pages. Usually, when we think about web pages, we
                    think about nicely put-together, pretty-looking sites, and so far what we have built has been pretty
                    bland, if not ugly. Once the browser reads the <abbr>HTML</abbr>, it will then read the
                    <abbr>CSS</abbr> and give different
                    styling rules to different elements in our <abbr>HTML</abbr> based on how we select them.
                </p>
                <h3>The <code>style</code> and <code>link</code> Elements</h3>
                <p>
                    Before we can add <abbr>CSS</abbr> to our web page, we need to inform the browser that what it is
                    reading is in
                    fact <abbr>CSS</abbr>. We can tell the browser that through <abbr>HTML</abbr> elements known as the
                    <code>style</code> and <code>link</code> elements.
                    These elements will go in between the head tags, as it is not necessarily data we need to appear on
                    the screen.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    There are two ways of including <abbr>CSS</abbr> in our <abbr>HTML</abbr>.
                </blockquote>
                <ol>
                    <li><p>We can write our <abbr>CSS</abbr> directly between two style tags:</p></li>
                    <li class="list_item_image"><img src="images/html_css_fundamentals/inline_style_example.png"

                    <li value="2"><p>We can link to an external <abbr>CSS</abbr> file using the link element. This
                        element will
                        include two attributes: <abbr>rel</abbr> and <abbr>href</abbr>. <abbr>rel</abbr> will refer to
                        the type of file we are linking: in this
                        case, “stylesheet”, and the <abbr>href</abbr> will point to the location of the file.</p></li>
                    <li class="list_item_image"><img src="images/html_css_fundamentals/head_styles_example.png"

                </ol>
                <h3>Introduction to <abbr>CSS</abbr> Selectors</h3>
                <p>
                    In order for us to apply styling rules to <abbr>HTML</abbr> elements, we have to know which elements
                    to apply the
                    rules to. This is where selectors come in. You can select all elements of a certain type:
                    <code>p</code>, <code>div</code>,
                    <code>body</code>, and <abbr>etc</abbr>. Or you can apply a class or id to each individual element.
                    We apply these selectors
                    to the <abbr>HTML</abbr> tags themselves in the form of an attribute:
                </p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="images/html_css_fundamentals/id_example.png" alt="Id or class html code example">
                </figure>
                <blockquote class="large_quote">
                    <p><strong><code>Id</code>s:</strong> are titles that can only appear on a single element. Think of
                        it as you would your driver’s license number. ONLY you have that one number.</p>
                    <p><strong><code>Class</code>es:</strong>on the other hand can apply to multiple elements. Think of
                        it like a classroom. Usually, you aren’t the only person in a class, although you might be. The
                        class is big enough for lots of people</p>
                    <p><strong>Individual elements:</strong> We do not need to add anything to use every element of a
                        certain type as a selector. <abbr>CSS</abbr> does that for us already.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <h3>Anatomy of Styling Rules (Syntax)</h3>
                <p>
                    Now that we have our selectors in place we need to tell the browser what to do with those selectors.
                    Inside of our style tags, we will insert the rules. Classes will always begin with <code>.</code>,
                    and <abbr>Ids</abbr> will
                    always begin with #. Elements will begin with neither and just have the element name. After the name
                    of the selector, we will use braces <code>(“{}”)</code> to hold our rules to that one selector.
                </p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="images/html_css_fundamentals/class_id_example.png" alt="Id or class style code example">
                </figure>
                <p>
                    Styling rules will need to adhere to a certain syntax in our <abbr>CSS</abbr> so that the browser
                    knows how to
                    read them properly. Within the braces, we will then have the name of the property, a colon(“:”), and
                    the value of the rule. This will be followed by a semicolon(“;”).
                </p>

                <h3>Styling Rules</h3>
                <p>
                    Now that we have some <abbr>HTML</abbr> elements selected, we can begin to add styling. There are a
                    LOT of
                    different ways you can style an object. You can control how big or small it is, what color it is,
                    where it is placed on the screen, or even if it is visible or not. We will go over some of the most
                    common styling properties and how to use them.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <code>background</code> or <code>background-color</code>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    Background can be set to a variety of rules. Most common would be setting the background to a color
                    or an image. Both are displayed below. If you want to be more explicit, you can use the property
                    background-color to only set the color of the background.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Color is used for text only. It will set the color of your text.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <code>font-size</code>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    We can’t use width or height for text, but we can determine the size of the font used. You can use
                    any size unit here that you would use with a font in a word processor (px, em, in, and etc). Px or
                    pixel is the most popular.
                </p>
                <h3>Introduction to the Box Model</h3>
                <p>
                    We can consider all html elements to be boxes. The make-up of each box is the content, padding,
                    border, and margin. This is known as the Box Model.
                </p>
                <figure>

                         alt="Box model example">
                </figure>
                <blockquote>
                    <code>height</code> and <code>width</code>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    We can tell the browser exactly how wide and how tall we want our element (content) to be. This is
                    used in <code>div</code>s, <code>img</code>s, and other height-based elements (in order to determine
                    the size of text, we will
                    need to use a different styling property). Size values can be in lots of different measures, but the
                    most common is the pixel (“px”).
                </p>

                    <img src="images/html_css_fundamentals/CSS_sizing_example.png"
                         alt="CSS sizing code example">
                </figure>
                <blockquote>
                    <code>margin</code>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    The margin is an invisible area that surrounds your element. This is the outermost area in what we
                    refer to as the <code>box model</code>
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <code>border</code>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    Border will set a border around your element. You can determine the size, color, and style of the
                    border. It will be set up in this order: width, style, color (a list of border styles can be found
                    here: <a href="https//developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border" target="_blank">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border</a>)
                    The border is outside the padding,
                    but inside the margin.
                </p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="images/html_css_fundamentals/css_border_example.png"
                         alt="CSS border code example">
                </figure>
                <blockquote>
                    <code>padding</code>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    The padding is the transparent area between the border and the content. It is very similar to the
                    margin.
