                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p><abbr>HTML</abbr> is one of the core building blocks of the Internet. You should learn what it is and

                    the basic tags to get content to appear on a screen.</p>

                <code>What is <abbr>HTML</abbr>?</code>
                <p>
                    Hypertext markup language. It is the language that web browsers read to build a web page. It acts as
                    a ‘blueprint’ to display data on a user’s screen. This is the basic building block of the web. Every
                    page on the Internet is just <abbr>HTML</abbr> at its core.
                </p>
                <code>What are <abbr>HTML</abbr> elements?</code>
                <p>
                    Elements are what we use to tell the browser how we want the data supplied to be displayed.
                </p>
                <code>What is a ‘tag’?</code>
                <p>
                    An element consists of an opening and closing tag. The data supplied between the tags will be
                    displayed per the instructions of the element.
                </p>
                <code>How does the browser use <abbr>HTML</abbr> to create what I see?</code>
                <p>
                    The browser reads and interprets the <abbr>HTML</abbr> file to understand how the developer intended
                    the data to
                    appear on the screen.
                </p>
                <code>What are the basic <abbr>HTML</abbr> elements?</code>
                <p>
                    The elements we learned about were <code>html</code>, <code>head</code>, <code>body</code>, <code>‘p’</code>,
                    <code>span</code>, <code>div</code>, and <code>h1-h6</code>

                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    There are dozens of elements available in <abbr>HTML</abbr>. However, just a handful are used 90% of
                    the time. I
                    will only cover the most commonly used in this lesson. You can achieve virtually anything you want
                    with the most basic <abbr>HTML</abbr> elements and some CSS (which we will talk about later). It is
                    important to
                    note though that there is an idea in web development that your <abbr>HTML</abbr> elements should
                    match the exact
                    information you are attempting to display. This is known as being ‘semantically correct’, and this
                    method uses all of the available <abbr>HTML</abbr> elements. This is done for a number of reasons
                    including
                    accessibility and SEO. We will not learn about this method in the lesson, but you should know that
                    it exists.
                </p>
                <h3>Attributes</h3>
                <p>
                    Before we jump into learning about a couple more <abbr>HTML</abbr> elements, let’s learn about
                    another way to
                    supply data to an element. We know that we can supply text between two tags, but what if what we are
                    trying to display cannot be textually based? We can include this data with special flags right
                    inside of our tags. This is known as an attribute. We will see attributes in action in the next
                    section.
                </p>
                <h3>More Elements</h3>
                <blockquote>
                    <code>&#60;a&#62;</code>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    The ‘a’ (“anchor”) element, allows us to create links to other web pages (or even to other areas
                    within our own web page). You will always see the ‘a’ element used with the href attribute to tell
                    the browser what address you want the link to point to.
                </p>
                <img src="images/html_css_fundamentals/anchor_example.png" alt="Anchor code example">
                <blockquote>
                    <code>&#60;img&#62;</code>
                </blockquote>
                <img src="images/html_css_fundamentals/img_example.png" alt="Image code example">
                <p>
                    This element will display an image on the screen. It will always have an ‘src’ attribute which
                    points to the address of the image to be displayed. NOTE: img tags can be self-closing, as in they
                    do not need two tags. Simply put the / before the closing bracket in the first tag:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <code>&#60;ul&#62;</code> and <code>&#60;ol&#62;</code>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    This element represents an “unordered list”. This is the parent element and will contain list items.
                    There is also an ordered list &#60;ol&#62;, but is rarely used in modern web development, as most
                    developers like to style their lists themselves.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <code>&#60;li&#62;</code>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    The companion to the <code>&#60;ul&#62;</code> and <code>&#60;ol&#62;</code>. These elements
                    represent the items to appear in the list. Any other elements can appear in an
                    <code>&#60;li&#62;</code>.
                </p>
                <img src="images/html_css_fundamentals/list_example.png" alt="List code example">
                <h3>Nesting Elements and Indentation</h3>
                <p>
                    We’ve seen in previous examples that we can nest elements inside of tags. In fact, this is a major
                    part of writing <abbr>HTML</abbr>. Nested elements are referred to as <code>children</code> and the
                    top level elements as
                    <code>parents</code>. You will see this type of structure throughout your time writing
                    <abbr>HTML</abbr> (and all
                    code for
                    that matter). One thing to note is that while indentation is not a requirement of <abbr>HTML</abbr>
                    (nor of <abbr>CSS</abbr>
                    and JavaScript), it is still often practiced as a readability issue. We not only write code for
                    ourselves, but also for our teammates and those that come after us. Indentation lets your code be
                    much more easily read and understood.

                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    <abbr>HTML</abbr> is great, but <abbr>HTML</abbr> alone is plain and boring. This was the case
                    during early days of the
                    Internet: web pages were very basic, text-only sites. Then came along <abbr>CSS</abbr> (Cascading
                    Style Sheets),
                    which allowed us to put some color and style into our web pages! It’s like the difference between
                    black & white and color <abbr>TV</abbr>.
                </p>
                <h3>Introduction to Cascading Stylesheets.</h3>
                <p>
                    Before we begin, let’s think about the analogy of a web page as a house. In order to build a house,
                    we need a few things. First, we need raw materials. Then, we need a plan. Then, we need paint and
                    decorations. Finally, we need electricity and plumbing to make everything work*. In this analogy,
                    our <abbr>HTML</abbr> is our raw materials. It has so much potential, but it’s just laying in a pile
                    on the
                    ground. We need a plan and a way to spruce it up and decorate it. That is where <abbr>CSS</abbr>
                    comes in.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    *the electricity and plumbing represents JavaScript which we will learn about later.
                </blockquote>
                <h3>What is <abbr>CSS</abbr>?</h3>
                <p>
                    As already mentioned, <abbr>CSS</abbr> stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a different language
                    than <abbr>HTML</abbr>.
                    It allows us to add color and style to our web pages. Usually, when we think about web pages, we
                    think about nicely put-together, pretty-looking sites, and so far what we have built has been pretty
                    bland, if not ugly. Once the browser reads the <abbr>HTML</abbr>, it will then read the
                    <abbr>CSS</abbr> and give different
                    styling rules to different elements in our <abbr>HTML</abbr> based on how we select them.
                </p>
                <h3>The <code>style</code> and <code>link</code> Elements</h3>
                <p>
                    Before we can add <abbr>CSS</abbr> to our web page, we need to inform the browser that what it is
                    reading is in
                    fact <abbr>CSS</abbr>. We can tell the browser that through <abbr>HTML</abbr> elements known as the
                    <code>style</code> and <code>link</code> elements.
                    These elements will go in between the head tags, as it is not necessarily data we need to appear on
                    the screen.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    There are two ways of including <abbr>CSS</abbr> in our <abbr>HTML</abbr>.
                </blockquote>
                <ol>
                    <li><p>We can write our <abbr>CSS</abbr> directly between two style tags:</p></li>
                    <li class="list_item_image"><img src="images/html_css_fundamentals/inline_style_example.png"
                                                     alt="Inline style example"></li>
                    <li value="2"><p>We can link to an external <abbr>CSS</abbr> file using the link element. This
                        element will
                        include two attributes: <abbr>rel</abbr> and <abbr>href</abbr>. <abbr>rel</abbr> will refer to
                        the type of file we are linking: in this
                        case, “stylesheet”, and the <abbr>href</abbr> will point to the location of the file.</p></li>
                    <li class="list_item_image"><img src="images/html_css_fundamentals/head_styles_example.png"
                                                     alt="Head style example"></li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Introduction to <abbr>CSS</abbr> Selectors</h3>
                <p>
                    In order for us to apply styling rules to <abbr>HTML</abbr> elements, we have to know which elements
                    to apply the
                    rules to. This is where selectors come in. You can select all elements of a certain type:
                    <code>p</code>, <code>div</code>,
                    <code>body</code>, and <abbr>etc</abbr>. Or you can apply a class or id to each individual element.
                    We apply these selectors
                    to the <abbr>HTML</abbr> tags themselves in the form of an attribute:
                </p>
                <img src="images/html_css_fundamentals/id_example.png" alt="Id or class code example">
                <blockquote class="large_quote">
                    <p><strong><code>Id</code>s:</strong> are titles that can only appear on a single element. Think of
                        it as you would your driver’s license number. ONLY you have that one number.</p>
                    <p><strong><code>Class</code>es:</strong>on the other hand can apply to multiple elements. Think of
                        it like a classroom. Usually, you aren’t the only person in a class, although you might be. The
                        class is big enough for lots of people</p>
                    <p><strong>Individual elements:</strong> We do not need to add anything to use every element of a
                        certain type as a selector. <abbr>CSS</abbr> does that for us already.</p>
